This is the `gh-pages` branch of the Programming languages Zoo.

You may run

    ./build-pages.sh

to create the pages. It assumes that the master branch is available (and up to date) is in
`../plzoo`. The generated pages can then be inspected locally with

    ./run-server.sh

You have to commit and push the generated pages by hand.
